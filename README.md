# LightShotScraper
A little js web scraper to get random lightshot images

To change the number of screenshots per run, edit the number 7 in the whole loop. This program isn't designed or polished for complete public use, but I am posting it because its fun to play with

## First time setup

Requirements: Node.js

Before running, make sure to run "npm init" and then "npm i puppeteer"

You should be tood to go after that, remember that lightshot bans IP's after scraping too many images, so use a proxy or vpn first
